The Windows script has been tested on Windows 7 only.  However, it
should work fine on other recent versions of Windows too.

The Linux/Mac script has been tested with [bash][], [ksh][] and
[zsh][] on Debian and Mac as well as with [dash][], [posh][] and
[yash][yash] on Debian.  It should work fine on any POSIX compliant
system with a POSIX compliant shell.

Necessity
---------

This project was written to address the following needs.

 1. Running `gvim foo.txt` on Windows or Linux, or `mvim foo.txt` on
    Mac, opens the file in a new GVim or MacVim window.  Launching
    GVim or MacVim from the shell in this manner again and again can
    easily clutter the desktop with too many windows.  Moreover, if
    the file being opened is already open in another instance of GVim
    or MacVim, the editor warns about an existing swap file and
    requires the user to take action for it.  This can be distracting
    sometimes.

    Of course, one can open and edit all files from within a single
    GVim or MacVim instance with the editor commands such as `:e` or
    `:tabe` to avoid these problems, but it is still useful to be able
    to edit files from the shell, especially while navigating
    directories in the shell.

    Vimer offers a way to edit files from the shell such that every
    file being edited opens in a new buffer in the same instance of
    GVim or MacVim.  If a file being opened is already open in GVim or
    MacVim, no warning occurs; instead the editor silently displays
    the specified file.

 2. The problems discussed in the previous point can also be solved
    using a simple wrapper script on Windows, say, myvim.cmd.

    ```bat
    @echo off
    gvim --remote-silent %*
    ```

    Or using alias on Linux.

    ```sh
    alias myvim="gvim --remote-silent"
    ```

    Here is a similar alias for Mac.

    ```sh
    alias myvim="mvim --remote-silent"
    ```

    But this solution is not without flaws.  Of course, it takes care
    that a command like `myvim foo.txt bar.txt` opens both files in
    two buffers in the same instance of GVim or MacVim.  However the
    following annoying behaviour occurs.

      - Running `myvim` without arguments leads to an error: `Argument
        missing after: "--remote-silent"`.

      - Trying to pipe standard output of one command into the
        standard input of GVim or MacVim with a command like `ls |
        myvim -` results in an empty buffer for a file named `-`.  The
        reason for this is documented in the editor's documentation.
        Enter `:help remote` in the editor to read it.

    Vimer offers a litle more elaborate wrapper script that handles
    these special cases better.

      - `vimer foo.txt bar.txt` opens both files in the same instance
         of GVim or MacVim.

      - `vimer` launches a new instance of GVim or MacVim.

      - `ls | vimer -` shows the output of `ls` in an existing
        instance of GVim or MacVim if it exists.

 3. Vim provides a context menu option called *Edit with Vim* that
    opens a file in a new buffer in an *existing* tab page in an
    existing instance of GVim.  However, it doesn't provide a context
    menu option that opens a file in a *new* tab page in an existing
    instance of GVim.  Vimer fills this gap by creating a context menu
    option for files called *Edit with GVim tab* that opens a file in
    a new tab page in an existing instance of GVim.  This feature is
    available only for Windows.


Current Development Status
--------------------------

You might notice that this project has not received a new release for
many years now.  This is due to the following three reasons:

  - This project worked well for me as long as I used Vim actively.

  - I use Emacs as my primary computing environment these days.  As I
    result I use this project only occassionally these days.  When I
    do use Vim, this project works well for me.

  - In the initial few releases of this, I took great care to run the
    test suite in the [test/](test/) directory with various shells.  I
    do not have the time and resources to perform such testing
    anymore.  As a result, I am reluctant to make any changes to this
    project anymore.

Due to the points mentioned above, I do not accept pull requests to
this project.  If this project works for you, that's great!  However,
if it does not, I hope you will be able to dive into the Vimer script
that you use and update the script to suit your needs.

Alternatively, you could also use Konfekt's fork of Vimer available at
[github.com/konfekt/vimer](https://github.com/konfekt/vimer) which
provides certain enhancements pertaining to locating the Vim
executable more flexibly.


Getting Started
---------------

Vimer is a single-file executable script.

Download [`vimer.cmd`][DOWNLOAD_WIN] for Windows, or
[`vimer`][DOWNLOAD_LIN] for Linux or Mac.

Copy it to a directory specified in the PATH environment variable.  On
Linux or Mac, make the script executable: `chmod u+x vimer`.

The following list describes some of the ways Vimer may be used.

 1. Launch a new instance of GVim or MacVim.

    ```sh
    vimer
    ```

 2. Edit files.

    ```sh
    vimer foo.txt bar.txt baz.txt
    ```

    If an instance of GVim or MacVim is already running, this command
    opens the files in separate buffers in the same instance of the
    editor.  Otherwise, they are opened in separate buffers in a new
    instance of the editor.

 3. If the `-t` option is specified, then files are opened in separate
    tab pages in an existing instance of GVim or MacVim if it exists.
    If no instance of GVim or MacVim already exists, the files are
    opened in separate tabs in a new instance of the editor.

    ```sh
    vimer -t foo.txt bar.txt baz.txt
    ```

 4. Pipe the standard output of a command into the standard input of
    GVim or MacVim.  Use the `-t` option to open it in a separate tab.

    ```sh
    ls -l | vimer -
    ls -l | vimer -t -
    ```

 5. Launch a new instance of GVim or MacVim with a specific server
    name.

    ```sh
    vimer -s FOO
    ```

    If the specified server name is already being used by another
    instance of the editor, a number postfix is applied (e.g. `FOO1`,
    `FOO2`, etc.) until a free name is encountered.

 6. Edit files in GVim or MacVim with a specific server name.

    ```sh
    vimer -s FOO foo.txt bar.txt baz.txt
    ```

    If an instance of GVim or MacVim with the specified server name is
    already running, this command opens the files in that instance of
    the editor.  If such an instance of the editor does not exist,
    then the first server with the number postfix will be used.

    If there is no existing instance of the editor with a matching
    server name or a server name with number postfix, the files are
    opened in separate buffers in a new instance of the editor with
    the specified server name, or a server name with number postfix.

 7. Enable a context menu option called *Edit with GVim* for files on
    Windows.

    ```bat
    vimer --enable
    ```

    After executing the above command, on right clicking a file, an
    option called *Edit with GVim* should appear in the context menu.
    Selecting this option opens the file in an existing instance of
    GVim if it exists.  If no existing instance of GVim already
    exists, then the file is opened in a new instance of GVim.

    A similar context menu option called *Edit with existing Vim* is
    already provided by the GVim installer for Windows.  But this
    option is provided in Vimer anyway because combining this option
    with `-t` creates a context menu option to open files in separate
    tab pages, as explained in the next point.  Such a context menu
    option is not provided by the GVim installer for Windows.

 8. Enable a context menu option called *Edit with GVim tab* for files
    on Windows.

    ```bat
    vimer -t --enable
    ```

 9. Disable context menu options on Windows.

    ```bat
    vimer --disable
    vimer -t --disable
    ```

    The `--enable` and `--disable` options are not supported for Linux
    and Mac.  See the [Context Menu](#context-menu) section below to
    read how to create such context menu option in other desktop
    environments.

10. For more details on how to use Vimer, execute the following
    command.

    ```sh
    vimer --help
    ```

Users who are very used to typing `vi`, `vim`, `gvim` or `mvim` to run
the editor and find it difficult to type `vimer` might want to rename
this script.  For example, a user very used to typing `vi`, might want
to rename this script from `vimer.cmd` to `vi.cmd` on Windows, or to
`vi` on Linux or Mac.


Troubleshooting
---------------

 1. When the script is executed from a 32 bit [Console2][C2] window
    running on a 64 bit Windows operating system, the script fails
    with the following error.

    ```
    ERROR: The system was unable to find the specified registry key or value.
    ```

    To work around the issue, execute the script in the native Windows
    Command Prompt, or install the 64 bit Console2 application and
    execute the script from a 64 bit Console2 window.

 2. After the script is renamed to `gvim` on Linux or `mvim` on Mac,
    running `gvim` or `mvim` with a filename as argument may still
    open the file in a new instance of the editor, not in an existing
    instance of the editor, even if such an instance already exists.

    If this happens, it is very likely that the `gvim` or `mvim`
    command is still running GVim or MacVim, respectively, not Vimer.

    To confirm, execute the following command on Linux.

    ```sh
    gvim --version
    ```

    Or the following command on Mac.

    ```sh
    mvim --version
    ```

    If the string "VIM" appears in the first line of the output, it is
    GVim or MacVim.

    If it is confirmed that running `gvim` on Linux, or `mvim` on Mac
    executes GVim or MacVim, respectively, ensure that the path where
    this script is located appears before the path where GVim or
    MacVim is located in the PATH environment variable.

    Further, on Linux or Mac, set the `VIM_CMD` environment variable
    to the absolute path of GVim or MacVim.  For more details about
    this, see the next point.

 3. When the script is renamed to `gvim` on Linux or `mvim` on Mac,
    and `gvim` or `mvim` is run, the shell may hang.  If the `VIM_CMD`
    environment variable is not set, internally, the script invokes
    the `gvim` command on Linux or the `mvim` command on Mac to edit
    files.  But when this script itself is named as `gvim` on Linux or
    `mvim` on Mac, invoking `gvim` or `mvim`, respectively, ends up
    invoking itself thereby resulting in an infinite recursion.

    To resolve the issue, set the `VIM_CMD` environment variable to
    the absolute path of GVim.  Here is an example for Linux.

    ```sh
    export VIM_CMD=/usr/bin/gvim
    ```

    Here is an example for Mac.

    ```sh
    export VIM_CMD=/usr/local/bin/mvim
    ```

    Consider adding this to the shell's initialization file (e.g.
    ~/.bashrc) so that this environment variable is persistent and
    available across shell sessions.

    As a workaround, consider renaming the script to something other
    than `gvim` or `mvim`, perhaps `vi` which is short and sweet and
    has the additional advantage that no matter what system it is, one
    only has to remember to type `vi` to edit files.

Context Menu
------------

This section descibes how to add context menu option for files that
opens files in an existing instance of GVim or MacVim in various
desktop environments.  This section does not require the use of Vimer.

The steps provided in the sections below create a context menu option
to edit files in new buffers.  To edit files in new tabs instead, use
the `--remote-tab-silent` option instead of the `--remote-silent`
option in the sections below.


### Windows ###

The following steps have been found to work fine on Windows XP and
Windows 7.  These steps probably work fine on other versions of
Windows too.

 1. Run the following command.

    ```bat
    regedit
    ```

 2. Go to `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell`.  Right click on the node named
    `shell`, select *New* > *Key*.  Name the new key as `Edit with
    GVim`.

 3. Then right click on the new node, select *New* > *Key* and name
    the new node as `command`.

 4. Now `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\Edit with GVim\command` should be
    the current node.  On the right-hand pane, double click on
    *(Default)* and enter the command to edit a file in existing GVim.
    Here is an example.

    ```bat
    "C:\Program Files (x86)\Vim\vim74\gvim.exe" --remote-silent "%1"
    ```

 4. Click *OK*.

To remove this context menu option, run `regedit`, go to
`HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell`, right click on the node for this context
menu, select *Delete* and click *Yes*.

Alternatively, run `vimer --enable` to automatically find the path to
`gvim.exe` and create the registry value described above.  To remove
this registry value, run `vimer --disable`.  To enable or disable
similar registry value that creates a context menu option to edit
files with existing GVim in a new tab page, run `vimer --tab --enable`
or `vim --tab -disable`, respectively.


### Xfce on Linux ###

The following steps have been found to work fine on Xfce 4.10 on
Debian 8.0.  These steps probably work fine on Xfce 4 on any Linux
distribution.

 1. Run *Thunar*, i.e. *Applications Menu* > *File Manager*.

 2. From the menu, go to *Edit* > *Configure custom actions*.

 2. Click the plus icon to add a new custom action..

 3. Enter the following details.
      - Name: `Edit with GVim`
      - Command: `gvim --remote-silent %F`
      - Icon: vim

 4. Go to *Apperance Conditions* tab and select *Directories*, *Text
    Files* and *Other Files*.

 5. Click *OK*.  Click *Close*.

To remove this context menu option, follow step 1 again, select the
context menu option, click the bin icon to delete the currently
selected action and click *Delete*.


### GNOME on Linux ###

The following steps have been found to work fine on GNOME 2.28.2 on
CentOS 6.5 and GNOME 3.4.1 on Debian 8.2 (Jessie).  These steps
probably work fine on GNOME 2 and GNOME 3 on any Linux distribution.
The steps below need to be performed in a shell.

 1. On GNOME 2, go to the ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/ directory.

    ```sh
    cd ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/
    ```

    On GNOME 3, go to ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/ instead.

    ```sh
    cd ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/
    ```

 2. Now create an executable script that contains the shell command to
    edit files in an existing instance of GVim if it exists.

    ```sh
    echo 'gvim --remote-silent "$@"' > "Edit with GVim"
    chmod u+x "Edit with GVim"
    ```

After following these steps, open Nautilus (File Browser on GNOME 2,
or Files on GNOME 3), right click on a file, select Scripts > Edit
with GVim.

To remove this context menu option, delete the script for the context
menu option from ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts (GNOME 2) or
~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts (GNOME 3).


### Mac ###

The following steps have been found to work fine on Mac 10.9.5
(Mavericks).

 1. Go to *Launchpad*, search for *Automator*, then click on it to
    launch it.  It should display a dialog box to choose a type for
    the new document.  If this is not displayed, click *New Document*
    to display it.

 2. Select *Service* and click *Choose*.

 3. In the *Service receives selected* drop-down list, select *files
    or folders*.

 4. Under *Library*, select *Utilities* and double click *Run Shell
    Script*.

 5. In the new pane that appears, go to the *Pass Input* drop-down
    list and select *as arguments*.

 6. Erase all the code in the text box and enter the shell command to
    edit files in an existing instance of MacVim if it exists.  Note
    that the absolute path to MacVim should be used in the command.

    ```sh
    /usr/local/bin/mvim --remote-silent "$@"
    ```

 7. From the menu, select *File* > *Save*.  Enter `Edit with MacVim`
    as the service name and click *Save*.

 8. From the menu, select *Automator* > *Quit Automator*.

To remove this context menu option, launch Finder, select *Go* > *Go
to Folder*, enter `~/Library/Services`, right click on the workflow
for this context menu option and select *Move to Trash*.
